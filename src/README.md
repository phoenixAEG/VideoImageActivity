Files in this folder are source files that the script depends upon to run

Depending on the operating system on which R or Rstudio is running, you will need to download and install the appropriate version

Currently, the only external source file used is Exiftool:

"ExifTool is a platform-independent Perl library plus a command-line application for reading, 
writing and editing meta information in a wide variety of files."

The most recent version of Exiftool can be downloaded from:
